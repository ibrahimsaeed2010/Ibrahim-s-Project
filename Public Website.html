       I live in Pakistan , one of the worlds most poorest countries to ever exist . <br /> I tend to spend most of

       <h3>Evening</h3>

       After all of this time , my mother is back from her job , so I turn into a normal human being , <br /> and my day then 
       comprises of hanging out with my father at night , sending him voice messages in a baby voice , and searching <br />
       through pictures of fat cats to find the fattest one . <br />

       <hr />

       <h3>Example Number One</h3>

       <hr />

       <h3>Night</h3>
       
       Usually , I search up some funny Lorem Ipsum , (Placeholder Code Text) and chill with my dad , and after <br />
       turning on the A/C , I go to the roof with my sisters to play badminton , and after successfully losing <br />
       all of our shuttlecocks , we return and sleep in the Air Conditioned Room , only after spending 2 hours <br />
       on my laptop watching .
